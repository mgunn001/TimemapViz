Timemap Visualization
=====================
A webservice implementation of ArchiveThumbnails and gets inherited from Mat's(machawk1) work https://github.com/machawk1/ArchiveThumbnails which itself is an implementation of
implementation of Ahmed AlSum's 2014 ECIR paper titled ["Thumbnail Summarization Techniques for Web
Archives"](http://www.cs.odu.edu/~mln/pubs/ecir-2014/ecir-2014.pdf) for the Web Archiving Incentive Program for Columbia University Libraries' grant, "Visualizing Digital Collections of Web Archives".


## Requirements

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is required to run the service. Once Node is installed, the packages required to use the service can be installed by running `npm install -g` in the root of the project directory. [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) may also additionally be required depending on your system configuration.

## Running

To execute the code, run `node tmvis.js`.

To query the server instance generated using your browser visit `http://localhost:3000/alsummarizedtimemap/?URI-R=http://4genderjustice.org/&ci=1068&primesource=archiveIt`, substituting the URI-R to request a different site's summarization. The additional parameters of `ci` is used to specify the collection identifier if not specified the argument 'all' is used, `primesource` gets the value of 'archiveIt' or 'internetarchive' as to let the service know which is the primary source.

### Example URIs

* `http://localhost:3000/alsummarizedtimemap/?URI-R=http://4genderjustice.org/&ci=1068&primesource=archiveIt`


## Running as a Docker Container (experimental)

Running the server in a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container can make the process of dependency management easier. The code is shipped with a `Dockerfile` to build a Docker image that will run the service when started. This document assumes that you have Docker setup already, if not then follow the [official guide](https://docs.docker.com/installation/).

### Building Docker Image

Clone the repository and change working directory (if not already) then build the image.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/mgunn001/tmvis.git
$ cd tmvis
$ docker image build -t timemapvis .
```

In the above command `timemapvis` is the name of the image which can be anything, but the same needs to be used when running the container instance.

### Running Docker Container

```
docker run -it --rm -v "$PWD":/app -p 3000:3000  timemapvis bash
```

In the above command the container is running in detached mode and can be accessed from outside on port `3000` at http://localhost:3000/. If you want to run the service on a different port, say `80` then change `-p 3000:3000` to `-p 80:3000`.

In order to persist generated thumbnails, mount a host directory as a volume inside the container by adding `-v /SOME/HOST/DIRECTORY:/app/assets/screenshots` flag when running the container.

Container is completely transparent from the outside and it will be accessed as if the service is running in the host machine itself.

In case if you want to make changes in the `tmvis` code itself, you might want to run it in the development mode by mounting the code from the host machine inside the container so that changes are reflected immediately, without requiring an image rebuild. Here is a possible workflow:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/mgunn001/tmvis.git
$ cd tmvis
$ docker image build -t timemapvis .
$ docker container run -it --rm -v "$PWD":/app timemapvis npm install
$ docker container run -it --rm -v "$PWD":/app -p 3000:3000 timemapvis
```

Once the image is built and dependencies are installed locally under the `node_modules` directory of the local clone, only the last command would be needed for continuous development. Since the default container runs under the `root` user, there might be permission related issues on the `npm install` step. If so, then try to manually create the `node_modules` directory and change its permissions to world writable (`chmod -R a+w node_modules`) then run the command to install dependencies again.

### Running via Docker Compose

An alternate way of running the service container is using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). We have provided a default `docker-compose.yml` file to build and run the container easily. Provided that the Docker daemon is running and the Docker Compose binary is installed, running following command from the directory where this repository is checked out will build an image if necessary and spin a container.

```
$ docker-compose up -d
```

The `docker-compose.yml` file has port mapping as described in the previous section. Additionally it also makes the generated thumbnail persistent on the host machine in the `thumbnails` directory under this checked out code directory. Please feel free to modify or inherit from the `docker-compose.yml` file according to your needs.


### Regarding License
Though GPL Licensing was used for base (https://github.com/machawk1/ArchiveThumbnails) of this repository, but for this current one MIT license is in place and is changed with the permission from the original author @machawk1.


### Usage of the service

Running this service gives provides an user with the array of JSON object as the response (webservice model), which then has to be visualized with the UI tool deployed at http://www.cs.odu.edu/~mgunnam/TimeMapVisualisationUI/UIInitialDraft.html for which the code is available at https://github.com/mgunn001/TimeMapVisualisationUI
